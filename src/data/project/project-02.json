        " 1st Week - All liquids throughout the day with one meal for either lunch or dinner. Liquids can be juices, teas, smoothies and soups.",
        " 2nd Week - All liquids throughout the day. Liquids can be juices, teas, smoothies and soups. Slowly reduce the fiber intake by having more water, teas and juices.",
